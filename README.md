# Research Assistant 🧠

**Use a LLM assistants to become familiar with the research landscape.
Create a knowledge database, explore topics, identify relevant papers, and new trends.**


---

## 📖 Overview

Research Assistant uses different LLMs agents to assist researchers in various
aspects of their work.

- **Keyword Generation**: Generate highly relevant keywords for your research topic.
This agent, works in two steps. First, an LLM assistant is prompted to generates a
small list of relevant keywords, using its own internal parameters. Usually, this
first list is good, but not very specific and lacks domain-specific terms.
To refine the list, a small sample of titles from arxiv is fed back to the agent,
which uses them to generate a new list of keywords that is more tailored to your research.
- **Knowledge database**: Download papers from arxiv using the refined list of keywords.
The abstracts are vectorized using **bge-small-en-v1.5** and saved in a **Milvus**
vector database.
- **Topic Identification**: Use BERTopic to identify the main topics in the knowledge database.
Get a description in natural language of each topic and the get some representative papers.
Use the topic model to identify research topics, outliers, and recent trends.
- **Paper Scoring**: Explore the knowledge database using Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG).
Ask questions and identify which papers are a **must-read**.
